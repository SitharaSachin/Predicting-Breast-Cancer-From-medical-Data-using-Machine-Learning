Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict breast cancer malignancy using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. It demonstrates a full data science workflow including data loading, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

Features
- Loads and preprocesses the breast cancer dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Builds a Random Forest classification model
- Evaluates model accuracy and other performance metrics
- Visualizes feature importance to understand key predictors

Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
